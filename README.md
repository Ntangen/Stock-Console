# Stock-Console

This is a basic stock tracking app that I've been working on for a while in Meteor.

v1.1 - The basic app is stable. It offers a couple of useful features:
* - Users set up an account to work in. All data is kept private to that account.
* - You can enter any stock symbol and immediately get the price, daily change, and other basic info. All information comes from Google Finance. The app then keeps these stocks and lets you track their price moves.
* - I've made it pretty easy to add stocks to a Portfolio section, which tracks how many shares you own, their purchase price, and then calculates your total gain/loss.
* - There's also a post-sale tracking section. This is something I occasionally want to know - how did Stock X do after I sold it? While I know this encourages counterfactual thinking and isn't super helpful, it's still something I'm curious about.

vNext - The next big feature I want to add is alerts - something that I constantly find lacking in other stock tracking apps. Workin' on it.
